# DiscordContactExporter
Exports your discord contacts to a txt file from a privacy backup, great for re-adding friends after getting banned.

Simply drag-and-drop your "user.json" file from your Discord Privacy Pack (get this from Settings>Privacy & Safety>Request all of my Data) onto the window, and it will create a discord-contacts.txt in the same directory.
